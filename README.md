- 👋 Hi, I’m @tanyafilby,  tenacious, resourceful, quirky and an avid-DIY-er forged in NYC's often caricatured stereotypes of first-generation hustle, frugality and balancing family/traditional. 
- 👀 I’m interested in cooking, hangs with my tiny dogs (and my family, too), crossword puzzles, foreign movies/languages/news/media, and learning other languages (programming and foreign (currently Russian, Spanish, French, and Mandarin)). I also enjoy tutoring/teaching math...and checking out more advanced topics in math are on my wish list. You'd be stunned at how connected all the disciplines are by complicated theories that no one except enthusiast mathematicians appreciate. 
- 🌱 I’m currently working on my full-stack skills (which is too general of a term). I studying applied math which was mostly computational programming, and little outside of that. So, now I'm learning how to build websites, webapps, mobile apps, and connect with back end features. Learning a new language is easy, but navigating libraries, packages, and everything else is a bit more contextual so, simply a matter of expsoure/experience---though not anything I can't handle. I hope to start a successful business one day, and learn voraciously in order to grow closer to that goal. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ...anything? I still feel like an amateur programmer because I'm always learning something new. So anything that helps an intermediate programmer build confidence.
